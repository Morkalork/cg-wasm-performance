To build and run do:

```bash
npm i                   # install dependencies
node generate_data.js   # generate data
npm start               # start server
```

This will start a server on port 3000. The page only has one button that will allow you select a file. There are two files in the repo, smol_data.json and large_data.json. You will have to figure out the difference between them. The result will be shown in the console.

I want to thank GitHub Copilot for writing most of it. It was very helpful (it even wrote a lot of this documentation).
